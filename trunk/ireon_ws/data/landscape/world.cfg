################## HeightMap OPTIONS.


#
# Before using the paginglandscape2 plugins,
# you'll have to split your big heightmap file into pages.
# Use the Mapsplitter tool for that

#           Base file name for the landscape heightfield data
#           The file name MUST be LandScapeFileName.x.z.LandScapeExtension (ex: landscape.0.0.png)
#               and MUST be squared.

LandScapeFileName=ireon
LandScapeExtension=png

#           Height and Width of the landscape in number of pages
Width=1
Height=1

#
#           Size of the Heightfiled in pixels (must be (power of 2) + 1)
PageSize=129
#
#           Size of the Heightfiled in pixels
TileSize=33
#
## so if map is 2048x1024, with pagesize=257 and TileSize=64
# it gives  32 pages (8 pages width, 4 pages width), each 16 tiles so it's 512 tiles on the whole map.

#
#           Especialized 2D data loader.
#           Currently the only available loaders are 'HeightField', 'HeightFieldTC' and 'SplineField'.

# 32bits, RGBA images. (png, jpg, etc) RGB is normal information, in alpha we store heightmap
#Data2DFormat=HeightFieldN

#               heightfield file was compressed

################## LIGHTING OPTIONS.
