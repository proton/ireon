    <para>
    	<ulink url= "http://www.mxac.com.au/drt/GUT.htm" >Avatar 
    	games</ulink> segment their worlds so that players can't 
    	enter portions of the world without completing specific 
    	tasks. Designers do this to ensure that new geography 
    	content is gradually opened the user throughout the life of 
    	the game, <emphasis>preventing the user from experiencing 
    	all the geography content at the game's outset</emphasis>, 
    	thereby weakening the experience. (Character abilities, such 
    	as spells, are also <ulink url= 
    	"http://www.mxac.com.au/drt/SubGameVariation.htm" >gradually 
    	unlocked</ulink> throughout the game.)
    </para>
    <para>
    	I just thought I'd spend some time listing different styles 
    	of gates and keys. First, the most common mechanisms:
    	<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>Doors</emphasis>
          	<itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
            	Locked, requiring a <emphasis>key</emphasis> 
            	(found/acquired somewhere else) to unlock.
            </para></listitem>
        	<listitem><para>
        		Locked, with a <ulink url= 
"http://www.mxac.com.au/drt/PuzzlesProblemSolving.htm" 
				>puzzle-based</ulink> locking mechanism.
        	</para></listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>Guard</emphasis> &mdash; Instead of a locked 
          door, the way is obstructed by a guard who won't let 
          characters pass without the proper conditions. Some games 
          allow guards to be killed, negating the need for players 
          to meet the conditions.
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          <emphasis>Monsters</emphasis> &mdash; Monsters create a 
          "fuzzy" lock that's based on the player character's level. 
          Killing monsters not only "unlocks" the gate, but requires 
          action from the player and provides rewards such as loot 
          an XP.
        </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
    	Some solutions that restrict world access that 
    	<emphasis>aren't exactly gate-and-key</emphasis>:
    	<itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          	<emphasis>Cost</emphasis> &mdash; Travelling to the new 
          	area incurs a cost.
          	<itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>
            	<emphasis>Resources</emphasis> &mdash; Money to pay 
            	for a train ticket.
            </para></listitem>
        	<listitem><para>
            	<emphasis>Time</emphasis> &mdash; Crossing the 
            	barrier takes real time:
            		<itemizedlist>
            		<listitem><para>
            			<emphasis>Non-play time</emphasis> &mdash; 
            			The player is told to leave and come back 
            			tomorrow, by which point the character will 
            			have gotten to its destination.
            		</para></listitem>
        			<listitem><para>
        				<emphasis>Play time</emphasis> &mdash; The 
        				player must sit around and wait.
        					<itemizedlist>
            				<listitem><para>
            					<emphasis>Make-work</emphasis> 
            					&mdash; Sometimes a non-game 
            					activity is required, like making 
            					the character run for a kilometre 
            					(holding down the 'W' key for 10 
            					minutes).
            				</para></listitem>

      		</itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
          	<emphasis>Choices</emphasis> &mdash; The player cannot 
          	move across the barrier without making choices:
          		<itemizedlist>

        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Tight corridor</emphasis> &mdash; The 
        			amount of weight the character can carry is

        		<itemizedlist>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Hidden doors</emphasis> &mdash; 
        			Players only get through hidden doors if they 
        			(a) notice the appropriate clue, (b) are 
        			meticulous and always search for secret doors, 
        			(c) read the game walkthrough, or (d) are told 
        			by a NPC where to look.
        		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Inaccessible</emphasis> &mdash; 
        			Players can't get to the location until a NPC 
        			informs the player of the location. The location 
        			isn't even on the map (or menu).
        		</para></listitem>
      			</itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
        	<emphasis>Obstacles</emphasis> &mdash; For the player to 
        	get to the new section of the world, they must overcome 
        	a non-trivial obstacle, in the form of a sub-game:
        		<itemizedlist>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Climbing</emphasis> &mdash; A climbing 
        			game.
        		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Jumping</emphasis> &mdash; A jumping 
        			game, with moving platforms and whatnot.
        		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Maze</emphasis> &mdash; The gateway 
        			isn't exactly locked. It's just difficult to 
        			find one's way through.
        		</para></listitem>
      			</itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
        	<emphasis>Preparation</emphasis> &mdash; The player 
        	cannot pass without proper preparation:
        		<itemizedlist>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Skills</emphasis> &mdash; The 
        			character can't pass without the appropriate 
        			skill level. Since skills are often chosen by 
        			the player, this becomes a resource allocation 
        			problem.
        		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Underwater</emphasis> &mdash; Proper 
        			water-breathing spells/potions must be acquired.

      			</itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
        	<emphasis>State</emphasis> &mdash; The place is a "state 
        	of being" that results in a different perception of the 
        	same world.
        		<itemizedlist>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Alternate reality</emphasis> &mdash; 
        			When the player puts on the ring of 
        			invisibility, they enter the world of shadows, 
        			which is half reality, and half filled with 
        			previously invisible creatures.
        		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Different perspective</emphasis> 
        			&mdash; If a player character gets knighted, all 
        			the NPCs in the game suddenly treat the player 
        			differently.
         		</para></listitem>
        		<listitem><para>
        			<emphasis>Events</emphasis> &mdash; The "place" 
        			is an event. For example: The "place" is a dance 
        			where all the NPCs gather in a specific place 
        			and time. Unless the player knows the exact 
        			place and time, they won't experience the dance.
        		</para></listitem>
      			</itemizedlist>
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>
